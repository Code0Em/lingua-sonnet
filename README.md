# LinguaSonnet

## Project Overview

LinguaSonnet is a platform that seamlessly combines translation and poetry, allowing users to transform their words into captivating poems. This README provides an overview of the project, user stories, APIs used, and a breakdown of tasks.

## User Story

As a student learning the English language, I want easy access to word definitions, pronunciations, and examples of the word in real contexts (e.g., poetry) so that I can understand how to use and say the word myself in my own speech and writing.

## Primary Audience

The primary audience for LinguaSonnet includes people wanting to learn the English language or anyone looking to expand their vocabulary in English.

## Problem

The challenge addressed by LinguaSonnet is understanding the meaning of words, their pronunciations, and how they might be used in real contexts, especially in poetry.

## Solution

LinguaSonnet provides word definitions with audio pronunciations and examples of the word in poetry.

## APIs

1. [PoetryDB](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb#readme)
2. [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/)

## Use of Local Storage

LinguaSonnet utilizes local storage to save user-searched words. When a user searches for a word and selects the search button, the word is saved to local storage, and a corresponding button is created. Upon selecting the button, the word is retrieved from storage, passed through the API URL, and the information is fetched again, displaying the word definition and poem on the page.
